    <h3> The Words of Christ </h3>
    <p> ...the words of Christ, if we follow their course,
        carry us beyond this vale of sorrow into a far better land of promise.
        ~ Alma 37:45
      </p>
    <h3> Let us TRY! </h3>
    <p> “It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong
      man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The
      credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena,
      whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly;
       who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort
       without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds;
       who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in
       a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement,
       and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly,
       so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who
       neither know victory nor defeat.”
       ~ Theodore Roosevelt

          Last week Sam had the chance to go to scout camp with his new ward. One notable
          comment from him about the experience. "It is hot in Texas!! and it doesn't
          cool down at night."

        Emma, Sam, Zeke, and Kyra, are now living in Texas, they are in
        Dallas/Fort Worth area, they moved last weekend. Cindy and I will
        miss them dearly. We will also miss going to all their activities.
        That being said, I am learning how to use snapchat and skype, so if anybody
        wants to get a hold of me, you can probably contact me there.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some great news, our baby has a brain (picture below). Cindy's pregnancy is
        going well, the baby is healthy. Cindy is also healthy, though she is very
        picky about what she eats right now due to nausea. We have an idea what the sex
        of the baby is, but we are holding off on letting people know until we have
        more confirmation.

      <h3>Memorial Day Weekend</h3>
      <h4> 3 June 2016 </h4>
      <p>
        Last weekend was Memorial Day. There are many to remember who have gone on
        before us. One that immediately comes to mind is Grandma Betty. She is a
        great example of what it means to be faithful and endure to the end. Thank
        you Grandma.
        It seems that Memorial Day has become a day to remember those who serve in
        are armed forces. So thank you, to my father, two brothers, and sister who
        have served. You make the world a better place.
        Emma also had a birthday. She is growing up. It is awesome to see the great
        choices she is making in her life we are proud of her.

      <h3>Zeke's last game of the season.</h3>

      <p>
          So the spring lacrosse season closed out yesterday with Zeke's last
          game. Zeke is the goalie and made some awesome saves, we think and
          his coach agrees he has some great reflexes.

          Cindy took a road trip with her sister down to the Arizona. So I am
          here working on the floors. Wow putting in tile can be a lot of messy
          work! That being said, it sure does look good when done.

      <h3>Emma Orchestra Concert</h3>
      <h4> 20 May 2016 </h4>
      <p>
        Last night was Emma’s final orchestra concert of the year.
        She is in her junior year, and it has been amazing to see the time she has
         put into playing the viola. Listening to the different orchestras playing
          last night, it was amazing to hear the difference between beginning
          junior high and advanced high school.  I have included and audio clip
          below they performed Tchaikovsky and a couple of other beautiful pieces.
          Well done Emma!!

        Saturday Baxter decided he didn't want be cooped up in the house anymore,
        he decided to make a break for it, out the front door. Our best guess is that
        once he was out he went into "hunting mode." Unfortunately one of the
        neighborhood Pomeranian's almost did not survive that experience. Due to this
        experience and many other experinces over the last year. We have decided
        that Baxter is not a good fit for our home and neighborhood, we took him
        back to the shelter earlier today. It was one of the hardest decisons we have
        made in our marriage. That being said we feel it is best for all involved. I have
        included a few pictures in memory of our, crazy, wonderful, difficult, and
        cherished Baxter.

        We went to the doctor's and I feel like I am safe to announce this, Cindy
        is pregnant, (pictures below for proof.)  I am very excited, there was
        lots of movement on the ultrasound and a good steady heartbeat. Right now
        it is a time of a lot of emotions, with the children moving soon, and this
        baby on the way. I am happy that families can be forever.
