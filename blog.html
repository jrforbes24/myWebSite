    <h3> The Words of Christ </h3>
    <p> ...the words of Christ, if we follow their course,
        carry us beyond this vale of sorrow into a far better land of promise.
        ~ Alma 37:45
      </p>
    <h3> Let us TRY! </h3>
    <p> “It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong
      man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The
      credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena,
      whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly;
       who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort
       without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds;
       who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in
       a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement,
       and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly,
       so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who
       neither know victory nor defeat.”
       ~ Theodore Roosevelt

    <h3>Emma Orchestra Concert</h3>
    <h4> 20 May 2016 </h4>
    <p>
      Last night was Emma’s final orchestra concert of the year.
      She is in her junior year, and it has been amazing to see the time she has
       put into playing the viola. Listening to the different orchestras playing
        last night, it was amazing to hear the difference between beginning
        junior high and advanced high school.  I have included and audio clip
        below they performed Tchaikovsky and a couple of other beautiful pieces.
        Well done Emma!!

    <h3> A weekend of changes </h3>
    <h4> 16 May 2016 </h4>
    <p>
      It is interesting how much things can change in a weekend, or even just a
      few moments.

      Saturday Baxter decided he didn't want be cooped up in the house anymore,
      he decided to make a break for it, out the front door. Our best guess is that
      once he was out he went into "hunting mode." Unfortunately one of the
      neighborhood Pomeranian's almost did not survive that experience. Due to this
      experience and many other experinces over the last year. We have decided
      that Baxter is not a good fit for our home and neighborhood, we took him
      back to the shelter earlier today. It was one of the hardest decisons we have
      made in our marriage. That being said we feel it is best for all involved. I have
      included a few pictures in memory of our, crazy, wonderful, difficult, and
      cherished Baxter.

    <h3> Baby Pictures </h3>
    <h4> 14 May 2016 </h4>
    <p>
      We went to the doctor's and I feel like I am safe to announce this, Cindy
      is pregnant, (pictures below for proof.)  I am very excited, there was
      lots of movement on the ultrasound and a good steady heartbeat. Right now
      it is a time of a lot of emotions, with the children moving soon, and this
      baby on the way. I am happy that families can be forever.

      Last night Sam was also part of the stage crew for the productin of "HONK."
      At the beggining of the performance they brought out the stage crew to
      introduce them, that was pretty cool. I have included a picture of what
      we see when Sam is hard at work.

    <h4> 15 Feb 2016 </h4>
    <p>
      So why start anything? Because. Can it be as simple as that? I think it can.
      However I am starting this one because I hope to share thoughts and feelings
      with this world that may make a difference.
