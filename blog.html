    <h3> The Words of Christ </h3>
    <p> ...the words of Christ, if we follow their course,
        carry us beyond this vale of sorrow into a far better land of promise.
        ~ Alma 37:45
      </p>
    <h3> Let us TRY! </h3>
    <p> “It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong
      man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The
      credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena,
      whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly;
       who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort
       without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds;
       who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in
       a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement,
       and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly,
       so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who
       neither know victory nor defeat.”
       ~ Theodore Roosevelt

      Last night Sam was also part of the stage crew for the productin of "HONK."
      At the beggining of the performance they brought out the stage crew to
      introduce them, that was pretty cool. I have included a picture of what
      we see when Sam is hard at work.

      So why start anything? Because. Can it be as simple as that? I think it can.
      However I am starting this one because I hope to share thoughts and feelings
      with this world that may make a difference.
